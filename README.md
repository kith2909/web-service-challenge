COCUS AG coding challenge
1. Please install requirement.txt
2. I've used local Postgresql database, insert correct available database data on your localhost into the file: model.py 
      DATABASE = 'flask_db'
      PASSWORD = 'your_password'
      HOST = 'localhost'
      USER = 'postgres'
3. I've made a simple client, which will make most of the tasks
4. For getting one line in the last uploaded file with different accept types - test with a REST client
Thank you for your time
Best regards.
